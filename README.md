## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **deployment of a machine learning model on AWS** using modern DevOps practices.  
It integrates CI/CD workflows, environment configuration, and cloud deployment to ensure reliable and scalable delivery of ML applications.



## ✨ Key Features
- 🚀 Automated CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**  
- ☁️ Deployment of ML model on **AWS**  
- 📦 Dependency management with `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`  
- 📊 Sample dataset (`insurance.csv`) for model training/testing  
- 🧠 Machine Learning workflow implemented in `main.py`  



## 🔑 Concepts Explained

## 🔹 Model Deployment
Deployment is the process of making a trained ML model available for use in production. This project shows how to:
- Package the model  
- Configure environment  
- Deploy to AWS for real-world usage  

## 🔹 CI/CD Integration
The `.github/workflows` folder contains automation scripts that:
- Install dependencies  
- Run tests  
- Validate builds  
- Deploy the model to AWS after successful checks
